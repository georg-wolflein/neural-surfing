\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{Describe the problem you set out to solve and the
extent of your success in solving it. You should include
the aims and objectives of the project in order of
importance and try to outline key aspects of your
project for the reader to look for in the rest of your
report.}

\chapter{Context survey}
\textit{Surveying the context, the background literature and
any recent work with similar aims. The context survey
describes the work already done in this area, either as
described in textbooks, research papers, or in publicly
available software. You may also describe potentially
useful tools and technologies here but do not go into
project-specific decisions.}

\chapter{Requirements specification}
Primary objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a generic framework that can be used for various neural training algorithms
    with a clear set of inputs and outputs at each step. This framework should include
    benchmarking capabilities.
    \item For a simple case of this framework (when the dimensionality of the control space
    and output space are suitably low), implement a visualisation tool that shows the
    algorithmâ€™s steps.
    \item Implement a particular training algorithm for the framework that uses potential field
    techniques.
    \item Evaluate the performance of this and other algorithms on tasks of differing
    complexity, especially with regard to the local minimum problem and similar issues.
\end{enumerate}
Secondary objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigate how this approach can be generalized to other numerical optimisation problems.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ethics}
There are no ethical considerations. 
All questions on the preliminary self-assessment form were answered with ``NO'' and hence no ethics form had to be completed.

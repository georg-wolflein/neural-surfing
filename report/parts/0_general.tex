\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{Describe the problem you set out to solve and the
extent of your success in solving it. You should include
the aims and objectives of the project in order of
importance and try to outline key aspects of your
project for the reader to look for in the rest of your
report.}

\chapter{Context survey}
\section{Neural networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``In practice, poor local minima are rarely a problem with large networks'' \cite{lecun2015}.
    \item ``The apparent scarcity of poor local minima has lead practitioners to develop the intuition that bad local minima (`bad' meaning high loss value and suboptimal training performance) are practically non-existent'' \cite{goldblum2019}.
    \item Other works proved the nonexistence of suboptimal local minima, but making various assumptions about the underlying neural networks \cite{kawaguchi2016,nguyen2018,laurent2018}.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Requirements specification}
Primary objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a generic framework that can be used for various neural training algorithms
    with a clear set of inputs and outputs at each step. This framework should include
    benchmarking capabilities.
    \item For a simple case of this framework (when the dimensionality of the control space
    and output space are suitably low), implement a visualisation tool that shows the
    algorithmâ€™s steps.
    \item Implement a particular training algorithm for the framework that uses potential field
    techniques.
    \item Evaluate the performance of this and other algorithms on tasks of differing
    complexity, especially with regard to the local minimum problem and similar issues.
\end{enumerate}
Secondary objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigate how this approach can be generalized to other numerical optimisation problems.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ethics}
There are no ethical considerations. 
All questions on the preliminary self-assessment form were answered with ``NO'' and hence no ethics form had to be completed.
